![](/recipes/images/chicken-enchiladas.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **2 tbsp** butter
- **1/2** onion, chopped
- **1 tsp** chili powder
- **1/2 tsp** cumin
- **1 can** enchilada sauce
- **1/4 cup** heavy cream
- **3-4** chicken breasts, cooked and shredded
- **1 cup** frozen corn
- shredded cheese

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425ºF.

Sauté the onion and butter on medium heat until soft. Add the seasonings and enchilada sauce. Once
bubbly, reduce heat to low and add the cream.

In a separate skillet, add the chicken, seasonings, black beans, and corn and heat through. Put the
chicken mix in a bowl and add enough of the enchilada sauce to coat all of the chicken.

In a large casserole pan, add a layer of the enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan. Add some of
the chicken mixture and cheese to the tortilla, roll it up, and place in casserole pan. Repeat
until you use up all of the chicken mixture.

Once all of them are rolled, cover with the enchilada sauce.

Sprinkle with remaining cheese on top and put in the oven for 20 minutes or until everything is
melty.
