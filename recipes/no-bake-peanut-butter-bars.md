![](/recipes/images/no-bake-peanut-butter-bars.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **1 cup** butter, melted
- **2 cups** graham cracker crums
- **2 cups** powdered sugar
- **1 cup + 4 tbsp** peanut butter, divided
- **1 1/2 cups** semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

In a medium bowl, mix together melted butter, graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar, and 1 cup
peanut butter until well blended. Press evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 9x9-inch square pan.
(If you prefer a thinner bar, use a 9x13-inch pan.)

In the microwave, melt the chocolate chips with the remaining peanut butter at 50 percent power,
stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Spread over the peanut butter layer. Refrigerate
for at least one hour before cutting into squares.
