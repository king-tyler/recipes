![](/recipes/images/beignets.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **1 1/2 cups** water
- **1/2 cup** sugar
- **1 envelope (2 1/4 tsp)** dry active yeast
- **2** eggs
- **1 tsp** salt
- **1 cup** evaporated milk
- **7 cups** flour
- **1/4 cup** butter
- oil for deep-frying
- **3 cups** powdered sugar

## Directions

Mix water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl and let sit for 10 minutes.

In another bowl, beat the eggs, salt, and evaporated milk together. Mix egg mixture into the yeast
mixture. In a separate bowl, measure out the flour. Add 3 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture
and stir to combine. Add the shortening and continue to stir while adding the remaining flour.
Remove dough from the bowl, place onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Spray a
large bowl with nonstick spray. Put dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a towel. Let
rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours.

Preheat oil in a deep-fryer or on the stovetop to 350°F. Roll the dough out to about 1/4" thickness
and cut into 1-inch squares. Deep-fry, flipping constantly, until they become a golden color. After
beignets are fried, drain them for a few seconds on paper towels and then coat them in powdered
sugar.
