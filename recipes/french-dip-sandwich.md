## Ingredients

- **1 (2-3 lbs)** beef or pork roast
- **2 (10.75 oz)** cans beef consommé
- **6 - 8** hoagie buns
- **1** package provolone slices

## Directions

Place roast in greased slow cooker. Pour consommé over the top of the roast. Cook on low 8 to 11
hours or on high 5 to 7 hours. Remove roast and save extra juice for dipping. With 2 forks, pull
apart roast. (When it is done, it should pull apart easily.) Serve meat on buns with provolone and
use extra juice as a dipping sauce for the sandwiches.
