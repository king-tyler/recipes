## Directions

### Meat sauce (prepare day ahead and leave up to 24 hours in fridge)

Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add in olive oil. Cook the onions, carrots and mushroom 5
minutes. Add in the chopped garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 mins or until fragrant. Add in in
the ground beef and sausage and cook until browned. Add in the red wine on high heat and cook off
most of the wine, approx 2-3 mins. Add in the tomato paste, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, sugar,
and all seasonings including fresh basil & parsley. Bring to a boil then simmer on low heat with
lid covering for 1.5 hours stirring occasionally. Taste for seasonings and adjust as necessary.
Allow to cool completely then store in fridge covered until it’s needed for assembly.

### Cheese filling (prepare this the next day)

Combine all cheese filling ingredients in a bowl, mix well with a whisk.

### Noodles (at least 2-3 hours before baking)

In a big bowl, put the noodles in and soak them in super hot tap water for 20-30 minutes.

### Assembly (at least 2-4 hours before baking)

In a 10x13 deep casserole dish or 2 8x8 deep pans, layer the lasagna as follows:

- Layer 1:
  - 1/3 of meat sauce
  - lasagna noodles
- Layer 2:
  - 1/3 cheese filling
  - 1/3 meat sauce

- Layer 4:

Cover and place in fridge until ready to bake. Or if you want to freeze for later, cover tightly
with a layer of aluminum foil then several layers of plastic wrap and store in freezer for up to 2
months (when ready to bake defrost night before in fridge and then follow baking instructions below).

### Baking

Preheat oven to 375ºF. Remove lasagna from fridge and leave on countertop for about 30 mins. Cover
lasagna with aluminum foil being careful it doesn’t touch the cheese on top. Bake for 25 mins
covered and then 30 mins uncovered. Then turn on the broiler on high for about 2-3 mins, monitoring
closely to ensure it doesn’t burn but broil until cheese is nicely browned. Allow to cool for 20
mins before slicing and serving.
