## Ingredients

- **2** chicken breasts
- **6** Swiss cheese slices
- **4** ham slices
- **1/2 cup** bread crumbs
- salt and pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 7x11 baking dish with
nonstick cooking spray.

Slice chicken breasts in half and pound them to 1/4" thickness. Sprinkle each piece of chicken on
both sides with salt and pepper. Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll
up each breast, and secure with toothpicks. Roll chicken in bread crumbs and place in baking dish.

Bake for **30 to 35 minutes**, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven, and place 1/2
cheese slice on top of each breast. Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
Remove toothpicks, and serve immediately.
