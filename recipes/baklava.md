![](/recipes/images/baklava.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **2 16 oz (1 box)** 9"x14" phyllo dough sheet
- **1 cup** clarified butter, melted
- **1 1/4 cup** simple syrup


### Simple syrup (1 1/4 cup)

- **1 1/4 cup** sugar
- **5/8 cup** water
- **1/2 tbsp** orange blossom water or **1 tbsp** orange zest or **1/2 tbsp** orange juice or **1 tsp** orange extract
- **3/4 tsp** rose water or **1/4 tsp** vanilla extract
- **1/2 tbsp** lemon juice

### Filling

#### Pistachio Filling

- **1 lb** pistachio, raw, unsalted
- **1/2 cup** powdered sugar
- **2-3 tbsp** ground pistachios, for garnishing

#### Walnut Filling

- **4 cups** walnuts
- **1/3 cup** sugar
- **1 tsp** cinnamon

## Directions

Prepare the simple syrup first and let it cool.

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Process the pistachios/walnuts and powdered sugar in a processor. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Split the amount into 2 portions, leaving some fir garnishing 

Unfold the phyllo sheets and smooth out to flatten. Cover with a damp towel, not wet, to prevent it
from drying.

Brush the base of a 9"x14" pan with some clarified butter. Place one sheet of phyllo and brush
again with ghee. Repeat to get a total of 15 sheets, brushing ghee in between each sheet. Add in
half of the ground pistachios/walnuts and spread evenly.

Add in one sheet over the nuts and brush by dabbing only because it will move if you brush it
normally. Add 9 more sheets, total 10 sheets, brushing in between each sheet. Press press down the
surface very well with your palm to compress the nuts. 

Add the other half of the ground pistachios/walnutes and top with 15 more sheets the same way you
did the first layer. Before brushing the top with ghee for the last time, press down the surface
really well again with your palm to compress the layers. 

Using a sharp knife with a pointed tip, cut the baklava into diamond shapes.

Place the tray on the middle rack of your oven and bake for 40 minutes. At this point the edges and
baklava should be lightly brown in color and you can turn on the top broiler for just 1-2 minutes
watching it closely until you get the golden color you prefer.

Remove from the oven and drizzle the simple syrup evenly all over the baklava. Use more or less to
preference. Garnish with ground pistachios. Allow to cool.
