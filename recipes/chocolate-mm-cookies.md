![](/recipes/images/chocolate-mm-cookies.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **1/2 cup** butter, softened
- **1/2 cup** sugar
- **1/2 cup** brown sugar
- **1** egg, room temperature
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract
- **1 cup** flour
- **1/2 cup** cocoa powder
- **1 tsp** baking soda
- **1/4 tsp** salt
- **2 tbsp** milk
- **1 cup** mini M&M's, plus **1/4 cup** for the top

## Directions

In a stand mixer, cream the butter for 20 seconds. Add the sugars, and cream until light and
fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla, mix until combined. Mix in the flour, cocoa
powder, baking soda, and salt. The dough should be pretty thick. Using a spatula, mix in the milk.
Stir in 1 cup of mini M&M’s.

Chill the dough for at least **30 minutes**. The longer it chills, the thicker the cookies will be.

Preheat oven to **350°F**. Scoop golf ball sized balls of dough into a baking sheet. Press a few
M&M’s into the top of each ball of dough.

Bake for **9-10 minutes**. The cookies will be done on the edges, but appear underdone in the
center. Let the cookies cool on a baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack
