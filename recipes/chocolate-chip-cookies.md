![](/recipes/images/chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg)

## Ingredients

- **3 sticks** unsalted butter
- **45g** water
- **80g** sugar
- **380g** brown sugar
- **2** eggs
- **3 tbsp** milk
- **2 tsp** vanilla extract
- **4 cups / 470g** flour
- **1 1/2 tsp** salt
- **1 1/2 tsp** baking soda
- **4 cups** chocolate chips

## Directions

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Gently swirl the pan constantly for
about 5-7 minutes. As the butter continues to melt, it will bubble and foam. When the foam
particles turn brown and a nutty aroma emits from the pan, remove from heat and allow the browned
butter to cool completely. Transfer the warm butter to the mixing bowl of your stand mixer and
cool in refrigerator for about 5 minutes, so that some of the butter becomes solid. 

Mix the dry ingredients together: flour, baking soda, and salt in one bowl.

Once the brown butter is slightly chilled, add the brown sugar, sugar and water to the mixing bowl
of a stand mixer. Mix on medium-high speed for about 2-3 minutes until the mixture becomes light
and fluffy and lighter in color. 

Add the wet ingredients and mix for another 30 seconds on medium-high speed, scraping the bowl down
as you go, then add the dry ingredients all at once, being careful not to overmix once the dry
ingredients are added. Add the chocolate chips, then fold the mixture with a rubber spatula until
fully combined. Set the dough in the fridge to chill for about 20-30 minutes.

Preheat the oven 350°F. Scoop cookie dough onto silicon mat. Bake 8-9 minutes until the edges are
golden brown.

Remove the cookies from the oven and cool slightly for about 2-3 minutes before transferring to a
wire cooling rack.
